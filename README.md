# Legends Arceus Blender Script
A Python script for Blender to import models from Pokemon Legends: Arceus (VERY WIP)

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this
https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html

The formatting of this script is a bit wonky, but that's because I wanted to make it
look as close to the original maxscript as possible.
That way, it's easier to compare the two and see what's different.

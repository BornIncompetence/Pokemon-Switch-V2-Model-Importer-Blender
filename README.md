# Legends Arceus Blender Addon 3.3.x
A Python script for Blender to import models from Pokemon Legends: Arceus (VERY WIP)

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this
https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html

The formatting of this script is a bit wonky, but that's because I wanted to make it
look as close to the original maxscript as possible.
That way, it's easier to compare the two and see what's different.

Download the models from here, they're prepared already for load them with pngs so you dont have to export or re-export anything
